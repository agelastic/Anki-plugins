# Anki-plugins
My Anki plugins, most of them are actually used, although Chinese-Support is the only important non-cosmetic one.

Simply the contents of my ~/Library/Application Support/Anki2/addons directory.

Cards themselves used this set up at some point, it evolved a bit since. Again, just convenience, nothing groundbreaking there.
